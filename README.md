Introduction
Python data analysis in healthcare(Viewed)

Course Project
Objective
The goal of this project is to apply everything we have learned in this course to build an end-to-end data pipeline.

Problem statement
Develop a dashboard with two tiles by:

Selecting a dataset of interest (see Datasets)
Creating a pipeline for processing this dataset and putting it to a datalake
Creating a pipeline for moving the data from the lake to a data warehouse
Transforming the data in the data warehouse: prepare it for the dashboard
Building a dashboard to visualize the data
Data Pipeline
The pipeline could be stream or batch: this is the first thing you'll need to decide

Stream: If you want to consume data in real-time and put them to data lake
Batch: If you want to run things periodically (e.g. hourly/daily)
Technologies
You don't have to limit yourself to technologies covered in the course. You can use alternatives as well:

Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure, ...
Infrastructure as code (IaC): Terraform, Pulumi, Cloud Formation, ...
Workflow orchestration: Airflow, Prefect, Luigi, ...
Data Warehouse: BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, ...
Batch processing: Spark, Flink, AWS Batch, ...
Stream processing: Kafka, Pulsar, Kinesis, ...
If you use a tool that wasn't covered in the course, be sure to explain what that tool does.

If you're not certain about some tools, ask in Slack.

Dashboard
You can use any of the tools shown in the course (Data Studio or Metabase) or any other BI tool of your choice to build a dashboard. If you do use another tool, please specify and make sure that the dashboard is somehow accessible to your peers.

Your dashboard should contain at least two tiles, we suggest you include:

1 graph that shows the distribution of some categorical data
1 graph that shows the distribution of the data across a temporal line
Ensure that your graph is easy to understand by adding references and titles.
